Built a Node.js API project using Express.js framework to
handle requests and responses, integrated MongoDB
database for storing data, and deployed the project on
Heroku

The project is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework.
It uses MongoDB as its database and Mongoose.js as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library.
The API provides endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on two main resources: technicians and categories.
The project also includes file upload functionality using the multer middleware.
The repository includes a detailed README file with instructions on how to run the project locally and test the API endpoints using Postman.
The project has a MIT license, which means it is open-source and can be used, modified, and distributed by anyone
